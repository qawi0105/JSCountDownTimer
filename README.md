# JSCountDownTimer

This code sets the date and time of the event and calculates the remaining time using JavaScript's built-in Date object. 

The countdown is updated every second using setInterval(), and when the countdown reaches zero, the interval is cleared and a message is displayed. 

The HTML and CSS provide a basic layout for the countdown timer.
